# git-intro

This repository holds material for an introductory git workshop.

## Preparation

Before we start the seminar, it would be great if you installed a couple of
things and signed up for a GitHub account

### Git

Install git https://git-scm.com/downloads.

This allows you to use ```git``` from the command line, and contains some
GUI tools

### GitHub

Set up a GitHub account https://github.com/join.

A free account is sufficient if your
work is to be open-source, or if closed-source repositories are limited to 3 collaborators.

### GitHub Desktop

If you are using Windows or Mac, you may want to download the GitHub Desktop app https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop

Installing GitHub Desktop comes with an installation of git as well.
